What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Git creates a new, hidden folder that stores metadata on the files
	in the repository.
	If you don't do it, git won't track commits

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

	the staging area is where files go to be prepared to be added to a
	commit. It is the inbetween point.
	It offers another level of control.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per 
logical change?

	You can check the changes using git diff
